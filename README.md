# Blog App

## Overview

The MERN Blog App is a full-stack web application built on the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It provides users with a platform to create, read, update, and delete blog posts. With a seamless user interface powered by React.js on the frontend and a robust RESTful API built with Express.js on the backend, users can efficiently manage their blog content. This application empowers users to share their thoughts and experiences through written posts, offering a dynamic and engaging blogging experience.
